# A search for di-Higgs production with ATLAS

### Introduction
This package implements a search for non-resonant and resonant di-Higgs
production in ATLAS data at the LHC using analytic statistical models. The two
Higgs bosons are tagged using the diphoton and bb final states, to provide 
a combination of good resolution and clean triggers and large cross-section. 

The code has been structured so that all of the general analysis settings are 
stored in the configuration file in the data/ directory.
